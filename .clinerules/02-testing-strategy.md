## Testing Workflow
- Run the full tests suite `pnpm test`
- Record all faling test files
- Fix tests in each file in isolation
- once all tests for a given file are passing, record any lessons learnt in the memory bank and commit
- once all tests are passing, run a build `pnpm build`
- fix any buuild issues
- once the project is building and all tests pass save any lessons learnt to the memory bank and commit
