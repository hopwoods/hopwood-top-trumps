## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Always put comments in the code to explain why and how.
- Co-locate test files, typescript type files, and CSS (Griffel CSS in JS files) with the react component files
- folders should be name using Pascal Case
- files should be name using Pascal Case
