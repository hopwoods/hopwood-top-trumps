# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Completed implementation and testing of the User Registration Page.

## Recent Changes
- Reviewed and confirmed existing UI (`RegisterPage.tsx`), custom hook (`UseRegisterPage.ts`), XState actor (`RegisterWithEmail.actor.ts`), types (`AppMachine.types.ts`), and machine logic (`AppMachine.ts`) for the registration flow.
- Verified styling (`RegisterPage.styles.ts`) aligns with the project theme.
- Created unit tests for `RegisterPage` in `src/Components/Auth/RegisterPage.test.tsx`, covering rendering, input handling, validation, error display, and loading states. Addressed ESLint and TypeScript issues in the test file.
- Created E2E tests for the registration flow in `src/Components/Auth/RegisterPage.e2e.ts` using Playwright, covering successful registration, password mismatch errors, generic error handling, and loading states.

## Next Steps
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Run linting, all tests (unit and E2E), and build to ensure project integrity.
- If all checks pass, proceed to the next planned feature: Enhancing the Home Page.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensured the registration flow correctly integrates with Firebase Authentication via the `RegisterWithEmail.actor.ts`.
- Confirmed that UI components (`Input`, `Button`) are reused effectively.
- Maintained adherence to established coding standards and testing strategies.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Continued use of XState for managing application state.
- Custom hooks for component logic.
- Reusable UI components.
- Co-location of component-specific files (styles, types, tests).
- Comprehensive unit and E2E testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The existing structure for authentication components and XState integration is proving to be robust and extensible for adding new features like registration.
- Iterative fixing of ESLint/TypeScript issues in new test files is a standard part of the TDD workflow.
