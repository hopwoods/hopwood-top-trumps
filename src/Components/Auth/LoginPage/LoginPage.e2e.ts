    // Mock the Firebase signInWithPopup for Google
    // This is a simplified mock. A real scenario might involve more complex Firebase interactions.
    // We assume the Google Sign-In internally triggers a mechanism that AppMachine/AuthMachine listens to.
    // For Playwright, we often mock the *result* of the auth provider's call.
    // Since signInWithPopup opens a new window, direct mocking of its JS call via page.route
    // for the client-side SDK can be tricky.
    // A common strategy is to mock the network calls Firebase SDK makes *after* a successful popup.
    // Or, if the app directly handles the user object from signInWithPopup, we could try to
    // evaluate script to override that function.

    // For this test, let's assume the click on "Sign in with Google"
    // eventually leads to AppMachine receiving an AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS.
    // We will simulate this by ensuring the UI transitions as expected.

    // More robust mocking would involve intercepting specific Firebase auth endpoints if possible,
    // or using Firebase emulators. Given the current setup, we'll focus on the UI transition.

    // Let's refine the beforeEach to include a more generic success for Google sign-in,
    // assuming it might involve a redirect or specific token exchange that we can mock.
    // However, signInWithPopup is client-side. The most direct way to test this in isolation
    // without a full Firebase emulator setup is to ensure the button click triggers the
    // correct XState events and the UI reacts.

    // For now, we'll assume the existing mocks in beforeEach are sufficient for preventing
    // actual Firebase calls from succeeding/failing unexpectedly.
    // The key is that the `loginWithGoogleActor` in `AuthMachine` should resolve.
    // In a real E2E, this actor would perform the actual Firebase call.
    // In a mocked E2E, we'd want this actor's underlying Firebase call to be intercepted.

    // Given the complexity of mocking signInWithPopup directly in Playwright without deeper hooks
    // into the Firebase SDK's network layer for this specific call, this test will primarily
    // verify the UI flow *assuming* the underlying auth mechanism (mocked or real) succeeds.
